Definition of GGA:
GGA - essential fix data which provide 3D location and quality data.

where:
     GGA          Global Positioning System Fix Data
     123519       Fix taken at 12:35:19 UTC
     4807.038,N   Latitude 48 degrees 07.038 minutes North
     01131.000,E  Longitude 11 degrees 31.000 minutes East
     1            Fix quality: 0 = fix not available or invalid
                               1 = GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) mode, fix valid
                               2 = differential GPS (DGPS), SPS mode, fix valid
                               3 = GPS Precise Point Positioning (PPS) mode, fix valid
			       4 = Real Time Kinematic (RTK). Satellite system used in 
                                    RTK mode with fixed integers.
			       5 = Float RTK.  Satellite system used in RTK mode with 
                                    floating integers.
                               6 = Estimated (dead reckoning) mode
			       7 = Manual input mode
			       8 = Simulator mode
     08           Number of satellites being tracked
     0.9          Horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP)
     545.4,M      Altitude above mean sea level [meters]
     46.9,M       Height of geoid (mean sea level) above WGS84
                      ellipsoid [meters]
     (empty field) Time in seconds since last DGPS update
     (empty field) DGPS station ID number
     *47          Checksum, always begins with *

If the height of geoid is missing then the altitude should be suspect. Some 
non-standard implementations report altitude with respect to the ellipsoid 
rather than geoid altitude. Some units do not report negative altitudes at 
all. This is the only sentence that reports altitude.
